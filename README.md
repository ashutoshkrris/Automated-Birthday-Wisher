# Using-Python

This is a program which will automatically send birthday wishes to your friends using your gmail credentials.
The program uses the following libraries in Python :

1. pandas ( `pip install pandas`)
2. datetime
3. smtplib

Make sure you have installed them already.
Or do this using pip command.

Additional requirements :
* xlrd `pip install xlrd` 
* openpyxl `pip install openpyxl`

Also, keep an excel sheet ready. The excel sheet must contain the following details : Name , Email , Birthday and Year. You may add other details also.
And the last requirement is to switch on lesser secure apps on gmail.

If you feel any problem,feel free to contact @ ashutoshbritish@gmail.com
